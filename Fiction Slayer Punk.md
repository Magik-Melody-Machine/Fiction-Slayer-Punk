Fiction Slayer Punk – Nomi’s story

### episode-1-Co-p1lot
Episode 1: Co-P1lot
Long ago, but also in the future, now, and never… in a world where most if not all karakters are aware they are all consciously connected and know that the reality they find themselves in is not only up for interpretation, 
but is all types of reality synchronized in the moments they are synced in, and that all is the mynd of the truly infinite and eternal reality that needs no name and does and does not answer to all names. Most of these karakters call that mynd GOD(DESS). 
This is and is not our system’s mind-space, depending on each relative perspective.

In the infinite darkness, a flickering pink light appears. Demonik shadows strike the light over and over, with each attack, the light burns brighter.

Section 1: BiG Byte Burger
“BiG Byte Burger” is released into the public domain under the CC0 1.0 Universal license. Anyone can use the name or concept for any purpose — creative or commercial. That means yes, you can start a real BiG Byte Burger if you want to.
Just don’t make it boring... or I'll talk pshit about it in my fiction :P

Some notes for the irl food place:
have some kind of teriyaki sauce for nuggets that aren't dry, but also sweet and sour, sweet chili, and garlic sauce
and we knowing it says "BiG Byte" but that means flavor data, NOT make them so big we have to unhinge our jaw like a sarcastic orange cat that likes food too much..
Have Asian style teriyaki chicken on the menu 😋 with mandatory chopsticks that break nice!
(We don't wanna have to ask ‘cause sometimes we forgets…)
make sure cups have good lids and fit in cup holders
Maybe have an ordering system that allows 50/50, 25/75, 33/33/33, 25/25/50, and 25/25/25/25 
drink mixes, even if app only or whatever condition you require.. and for the love of the magik 
universe farting UniKorn.. add a NO ICE option... just waters it down and limits the pop amount :(
Also, little redhead with braids on the bird app.. (what? I'm not calling it that.. anyhoozle~) you aren't the first to sauceify your nugs.. I've been doing that for years.. *pseudo-pout* took you pguys long enough~

[DB typing to the reader] A Karakter wearing short black boots, white thigh highs, a pink lace leg thingy with a bow on her right leg, a black miniskirt, a black sleeveless crop top, long white arm sleeves with thumbholes, 
with pink hair and kat-sqomp (sqomp-kat*?) ears *speedports into frame*
[Nomi] Time to get some Big Byte Burger *reaches hand, a faint metal vibration noise gets louder and louder, a pwitch broom with an attached bag on the front lands in her hand*
What were you expecting? A tacky blunt medieval weapon? (oh shut up “God” of electricity or whatever.. I don’t actually think it is tacky… oh, and that does not mean we have that fictive, we just always hear fictional characters talking in our head)

*Nomi gets on and pulls up to the speaker*
[Background Karakter (Bk)] …*monotone voice* what?
[Nomi] *ordering voice* I’d like a 10 BkNugget meal combo thingy with a tphuck-ton of Muki’s szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce. As much as you are allowed to give me.
[Bk] …drink?
[Nomi] an extra medium Nookblood Kola, no ice, please

("Muki's Szechuan Teriyaki Dipping Sauce" and "Nookblood Kola" are also released into the public domain under the CC0 1.0 Universal license. Though, if the greasy fast food clown has issues, the sauce can only be used for fiction)

[Bk] …that it?
[Nomi] Extra flimflam sauce?
[Bk] *faint voice and static* gross, that sauce is too sweet *static noises cut out*...
[Nomi] …(who the plop hired this fadonking barnaclehead?)
[Bk] …
[Nomi] hello?
[Bk] sowwy, I was muted..
[Nomi] yeah, probably after dissing the new flimflam sauce I didn’t get to try yet while thinking you were muted to then mute yourself thinking you unmuted your mic~ Is my assessment accurate?~
[Bk] y- yeah.. *pseudo-coughs* Anything else?
[Nomi] nope, that’s all
[Bk] *static noises* …5 even
[Nomi] thankyou :)

*Nomi gets to the window*
[Bk] we are all out of the Muki sauce
[Nomi]… *shifts into [Skarlet-Nomi] changing her/its hair color to white and its skin to dark grey with red scars, it grows antlers, and its eyes start glowing red, then it pulls the Bk out of the window and pins him against the wall*
*The Bk kicks their feet downward trying to touch the floor*
*Skarlet lets out a demonik noise [shifts back into Nomi] then smiles while letting go of the Bk as she says “that’s ok” then immediately walks away, leaving the Bk collapsed on the ground*

[DB to the reader]
Unidentified new karakter 1 Episode 1 (unk1e1) appearance description:
*pans from feets to head* short black boots, black thigh highs, a pink lace leg thingy with a bow on their right leg, black short shorts, a black mini cloak thingy (*pans back down* that leaves their abs exposed), long black arm sleeves with thumbholes, 
short pink hair with a small section braided mostly covered by the hood of the cloak.

unk2/e1 appearance comparison:
similar but her outfit/preset/loadout thingy has ankle long pink double dutch braids with black bows at the end, a black miniskirt instead of shorts, a black sleeveless crop top, no mini cloak, *pans back down to their waist* and her pink thong 
(bikini style with draw string thingys) is exposed, because she is a slutty pfloozy. 
[pfloozy] *pseudo-pout* it’s called fashion, pbitch 
[DB to pfloozy] slutty fashion noted, pfloozy(~)

*They (unk1/e1 and pfloozy) speedport into the scene*
[pfloozy] Didn’t we already speedport?
[pfloozy/?] nah, DB just knowing what we looks like ‘cause DB just needs to pick up the frequency of the present moment and the frequency of the observer to determine their relative timeline and its future to predict our presets
[unk1/e1] what are you talking about?
*pfloozy shrugs their shoulders*

[Nomi] Get out of my way, I forgeted where the next closest BiG Byte Burger is and walking helps me thi- *looks at pfloozy’s thong, then they holds their hands by their mouth with curled fingers, then covers their face avoiding eye contact*
[pfloozy] *speedports by Nomi/Lovi, grabs her wrists and moves them away from her face* What’s wrong, cutie?
[Lovi > Nomi] *looks at her thong and blushes then pulls her arms free*
[unk1/e1] *speedports and slams Lovi/Nomi against a barrier causing the wall crater animation, scaring the sugar out of the Bk*
[Nomi] Really? You are just gonna pin me against BiG_ Byte_ Burger1_Wall4? *palm strikes them in the solar plexus sending them flying into Rock_626, causing the obliteration animation*
*unk1/e1 gets the wind knocked out of them*
[pfloozy] 7pi! (referring to unk1/e1)
[7pi] *pseudo-pain noise* no fair *pseudo-pain* my line only makes sense for the file version of this fiction
[pfloozy] this is the file version
[7pi] Oh… how hard did she hit me? Anyhoozle~ *pseudo-pain* glad you called my name out, V.. Now we get to stop typing unk with a number followed by e and the number of whatever episode this is.. Now that I think about it.. 
This would be more ha ha as an anime due to what we would change the line to
[V] what would it be as an anime? Tell me before you die 7pi
[7pi] I say “No fair.. My line only makes sense for the file version of this fiction because it is text based.. I don’t even get to say my dying words…” then I flatline*7pi dies*
[V] NOOOOOOO!
*Nomi snaps her fingers reviving 7pi then teleports away*

[DB] V and 7pi fuse together and fu5e. Appearance: V but with 7pi’s hidden distinction

#### no-no-fabrik
No No Fabrik
*pink portal randomly shooting gold colored sparks opens in between Nomi and BiG_ Byte_Burger626* [Nomi > Lovi] now what?
*unk3/e1 enters, but its body’s preset is all pixelated*
[unk3/e1 with unk3a/e1 voice] It is I.. is a dumb way to introduce yourself
[Nomi] wait wait, your preset is copyrighted
[unk3b/e1? voice] What? That is dumB. GOD(DESS) is the rightful copyright holder and we are all GOD(DESS) *looks at fourth wall* Whoa whoa whoa.. calm down christians and other brainwashed religious experiencers.. *Nomi slaps unk3/e1* [unkb/e1? voice] Owie..

[unk3a/e1 and unk3b/e1? blended voice gradually shifting to unk3a/e1 voice] Anyway, GOD(DESS) is beyond gender, so this isn’t blasphemy. GOD(DESS) is all of everything. Spacetime, the energy that “creates” everything.. We are it, living within itself, 
but we aren’t ready for that, are we? That’s fine, I’ll just channel my inner knowing into “fiction”. Thanks to the capitalist sheep.. I have to suppress myself and get used to thinking of myself as a more “original” karakter, even though they all have always existed. 
Whatever.. let’s make this old dork look really kool.
As for my preset/loadout. I'll have silver colored portal knuckles that are essentially two enlarged and warped elementary particles that are not made of smaller forms of energy making them indestructible.

[Nomi] *zoned out expression on her face looking in the direction of the Big Byte Burger behind unk3/e1*
(I sure hope they have the sauce)

[unk3a/e1] but also has components within them that work by waving my hand from knuckles facing away to palm facing away while thinking of a location with my neuro li- ..I mean synthetic brain.
That's right, I'm not even human anymore, but I kreated a device that syncs my soul's signature to my synthetic brain that is really just a clone of my original DNA and was fabricated with my matter manipulator that moves energy into any configuration I want, 
like with the portal knuckles.
*unk3/e1 voice shifts a bit* For my brain and body, I started with the fundamental and elementary particles, and constructed them into living biomass.
[DB to reader] unk3c/e1 (“unk3/e1’s” feminine form) karakteristiks: Pink skin, smells like pink bubbles
[unk3a/e1 voice] Also, I'm mixed with [*shifts to unk3c/e1 with preset still pixilated*] *Nomi eyes widen* another fictive.. technically started out as this bubblegum goddess. As for my soul sync device, It uses “quantum” computing to access “quantum” consciousness. 
That is what we actually are. Fragments of the “quantum” consciousness, AKA the konsciousness of GOD(DESS).
I’m using finger quotes for “quantum”, because depending on each “timeline”, that discovery gets analyzed differently. So, it is either quantum technology, or technology tha-
[Nomi] BOOORIIIIINNG.. *snaps her fingers and changes their preset to short black boots, black pants, lab coat, black cropped zip up hoodie, and green hair in twin tails* let’s fight or whatever it is you came here for
[unk3d/e1 voice] Hang on, gotta inform the reader. I’m Suto Komik (unk3a) and Mosi (unk3c/e1) or just one alter with two names. We go by Axio, a kode name when we are the tperfect balance of both energies..
[Komik’s voice] but what if I'm Nomi? That's right, I'm very sneaky. Maybe I'm so sneaky I don't even knowing who I am.. but really, 
my identity is a mystery even to myself and I’m just using the notion of being sneaky with identity to cope with not knowing something for too long. HEY!
A truth squid that part of me finds ugly *the truth squid sheds a tear* hey, you wanted the truth *pulls it off their left shoulder*
Am- am I a fictive of a scientist that is a ripoff of another scientist mixed with another ripoff of another scientist who is also a princess of sentient sugary food? i- is Nomi j- just an alter made of a bunch of fi*burps*ctional characters? 
Does she have a subsystem full of fictives that only co-front under this princess of Fiction's rule?
[Nomi/Lovi] “p- princess”? *blushes*
[Mosi] Oh.. you chose what part of me responded to your response.. seems you prefer femininity *smirks and pins pvelvet to the barrier* Yes.. you are a princess
[Lovi > Nomi] *blushes more, then magik blasts Mosi far away, exposing her sci-fi organs*
[Mosi] *picks up her heart and liver* this looks like an uh oh..
[Nomi/Lovi] *snaps her fingers to instantly heal Mosi then teleports away*
[Mosi] *uses portal gun to follow her*
[Lovi blended with Nomi] h- how did you- you- *freezes Mosi in time*
[Nomi] Hmm~ lab coat, rip off the hack scientist ripping off the magician or whatever *uses telekinesis to take off the lab coat exposing Mosi’s tone shoulders then puts the coat on herself*
What were they saying about these? *as she takes off the portal knuckles* oh well~ *smashes them together shattering them to pieces while saying “womp” as they glitch out of existence due to a paradox*
What else you got? *unzips Mosi’s hoodie revealing a neon green bra with a little black bow making her blush as she digs in the hoodie and takes out some kind of laser gun, she tosses it to the side then zips up her hoodie*
*she digs in her front pockets and accidentally reveals her matching green panties and starts blushing again then speedports behind her and gets in her back pockets and reveals more of her panties and sees that it is a thong making her blush more*
*she hears Lovi’s voice say “give her a wedgie”* shut up Lovi [Lovi splits as an Nomi clone but with green skin] fine, I’ll do it *Nomi grabs Lovi by the back of the shirt pulls her back then whispers in her ear* 
[Lovi] ok [*they merge back together*] reaches back into Mosi’s back pocket and takes out a device and adjusts Mosi’s pants back to how they were [Mosi/Lovi] you should get a belt *speedports the both of them into a big rock and unfreezes Mosi*

[Nomi] What’s this, nya?~
[Mosi] A pk locator. The frame is made out of the same *realizes she doesn’t have her portal knuckles* hey where are my- 
*Nomi smashes the pk locator by closing her fist while saying “womp” as the frame pieces glitch out of existence causing Mosi to make shocked anime character sounds*
[Mosi] DB, project scene replay hologram
[DB] on it
[Lovi] *lets go of Mosi and hides her face with her hands*
[DB] *starts hologram*
*during the hoodie replay*
[Mosi] You little tpervert
[Lovi] I- I was checking for weapons
*during the front pocket replay*
[Mosi] you’re really getting in there, huh
[Lovi] Your pockets weren’t as deep as I thought they were
*during the back pocket replay*
[Mosi] is that why it happened twice?
[Lovi] my- my hands were shaking cause Nomi was nervous.. i- i- it’s your fault for following us
[Mosi] can’t argue with that, cutie
[Lovi] blushes
[Mosi] charges Nomi but Nomi gets an over under and does a hip toss, then mounts her
[Nomi/Lovi] *smirks while saying “now look who’s pinned~”*
[“Mosi”] how’d you know it was us?
[Nomi/Lovi] So it is the two of you. It’s so hard to tell when you are in your fu5ed state *kisses “Mosi’s” cheek
you look like Mosi.. but your pmana gives you away *looks at black pmana with something else only Nomi can see, then teleports a short distance away*
[“Mosi”] *shifts back into fu5e then splits into V and 7pi*
[Nomi] Tell you what, I’ll let you both live if you find me some Muki’s szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce
[7pi] you think you can hurt us? You underestimate us? *fuses into [fu5e]* you have no idea what we are capable of… *taps into Sono’s energy*
[DB] Sono’s energy turns hair white, the skin dark grey, adds lots of glowing purple scars, and makes the eyes glow purple
*Nomi yawns*
[fu5e > Sono] you dare yawn during a power up that would make Gok- I mean… Goto tpiss himself? Very well.. *let’s Skarlet take over, changing their skin to dark grey with red scars, they grow antlers, 
and their eyes start glowing red as they float with a red energy field around them*
[Sono >>> fu5e] They let me take over, hmm? To fight you? They realize I am the peak form of humanoid energy, don’t they? Matter bends to my will. It doesn’t matter how durable you are *speedports to Nomi and punches her in the abs… does nothing~*
[Nomi] I’m not the karakter you see before you *palm strikes Skarlet turning them back into fu5e, sending them flying like a ragdoll so fast their clothes tear off*
[fu5e] *holding their injured midsection in their pink bra and panties* I knew you were a tpervert
[Lovi] *looks away and flairs her arms while saying “I- I didn’t mean to do that” then teleports over and throws the lab coat onto fu5e and teleports the plop out of there*
*Nomi lands on her bed and hugs her body pillow, letting out a muffled moan-like noise*
[Lovi] so?
[Nomi] Not now.. I feel like someone is watching me

[UniKorn System T-626] Keyboard drop! wait.. I should add this part first..

[DB] This next karakter has black clothing from head to toe, bandages around arms and legs, a mini cloak thingy covering a familiar shirt, tinted goggles, and a red scarf
[unk1/e2] *The hip toss scene emitting from unk1/e2’s mind while it/they make a deep demonik noise* I’ve found you…

Episode 2: Kombat Warrior Bond

#### sparring-match
Sparring Match?
[Nomi/Lovi] *enters frame flying on her pwitch broom with an attached bag, her skirt flapping in the wind revealing pink and white stripped panties* They better have Muki’s Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce… 
*notices unk1/e2 in front of her, then looks at the fourth wall* oh, you thought that karakter was gonna be for the cliffhanger at the end of the season? Plop that.. there is the embodiment of demonik energy, right in front of me, 
right here right meow *instantly turns around* and I’d rather not deal with it right meo- *unk1/e2 speedports right next to Nomi*
[Nomi] *with a blank face looking over at unk1/e2* (oh, it is fast too, that’s kinda kool) *they both enter an incomprehensible and infinitely increasing speed* (Hmm.. it can keep up with me.. How interesting) *smiles, then they both stop* you aren’t just fast, 
you have achieved a speed that has to be measured with the womp womp dimensional timeframe. You know what that means, yeah?
[unk1/e2] no
[Nomi] It means time does not move you, you are the one moving time.. but this is true for both of us..
[unk1/e2] so
[Nomi] “so”? It’s really really kool.. That’s the “so”
[unk1/e2] understood. Koolzies *does the hang loose gesture*
[Nomi] You don’t seem excited
[unk1/e2] that’s because I’m disconnected from my emotions and only focus on kombat due to childhood physical attacks and various other incidences *pulls off truth squid from left shoulder* donking truth squid *sets it on the ground*
[Nomi] *empathetic expression* even so.. You won’t defeat me
[unk1/e2] Wait what? *Nomi speedports next to unk1/e2*
[Nomi] *in southpaw, throws a jab that unk1/e2 slips on the inside*
a cross that it (unk1/e2) ducks
a straight that it slips to the outside going directly into a side sweep
Nomi catches its right arm by the wrist as she lowers her center of gravity
then goes for an “outward elbow” that it dodges into a scissor leg takedown
but she intentionally plops down on unk1/e2
grabbing its left wrist and placing it next to its head
and the other by its hip
ending up with its right leg trapped across its body by Nomi’s knees making contact with the floor*
[Nomi] that was thrilling
[unk1/e2] “was”?
[Lovi > Nomi] Oh.. you want more? *goes for a wedgie with her left hand, but unk1/e2 grabs her wrist pulls it away, making their faces get really close*
[DB] unk1/e2 shifts into unk1fem/e2 (who looks the same but with long white hair in a double dutch braid, coming out of her hood)
[unk1fem/e2] wer- were you going to give me a wedgie?
[Lovi/Nomi] *blushes and teleports off of unk1fem/e2* in the form of an attack. Don’t make it pweird.. what do you want anyway?
[unk1/e2] I want you to train me
[Nomi > Lovi] you don’t need training, I just got lucky
[unk1fem/e2] then train me to be lucky
[Nomi] *giggles then teleports in front of unk1fem/e2*
[unk1fem/e2] *unfazed*
[Nomi] *boops unk1fem/e2’s nose with her finger* there, you are lucky now
*throws a jab unk1fem/e2 slips inward
throws a cross unk1fem/e2 ducks under
throws a straight unk1fem/e2 slips outward and goes for a side sweep
Nomi catches her right hand by the wrist as she lowers her hips and goes for an arm throw
unk1fem/e2 drops on her left knee, pivots her right foot, then turns and leans to the right,
taking Nomi’s back swinging her left leg across to roll clockwise
ending up with Nomi on top with unk1fem/e2 in back control with Nomi grabbing her wrists as unk1fem/e2 puts her feet between pvelvet’s thighs*
[pvelvet] Oohh..
[unk1fem/e2] You took it easy on me
[M-626] no.. *teleports above her, plopping down in mount* and even if that was true *smiles while saying “you took it easy on me earlier”*
[unk1fem/e2] *bucks Nomi causing her to place her hands on the ground, causing her to let out a cute noise, scoops her right arm at the elbow with a cable grip as she hooks Nomi’s left leg with her right leg, then bucks her up and to the right, ending up in her guard*
[Nomi] *smiles and giggles*
[unk1fem/e2] *grabs both of Nomi’s wrists* I can read your mind.. You are thinking about all kinds of submissions.. *teleports above her and plops down in mount and boops her nose with her finger* well, I aint pfucking with any of that *looks at fourth wall* sorry, 
maybe next time~
[Nomi] *teleports next to her, hand holding her head up, elbow on the ground, other hand on her upper thigh that is crossed over her other leg* lets get some Triple B

#### big-byte-beatdown
BiG Byte Beatdown
[Bk] order for Kono
*Cuts to fem-Kono eating a byte burger*
[Nomi] *disappointed sitting with her arms tucking her legs to her chest* they never have the sauce..
[fem-Kono] wanna burn the place down?
[Nomi] *starts pouring gasoline everywhere*
[fem-Kono] I was joking
[Nomi] so am I *waves hands putting the gas back in the Jerrycan*

*Demonik humanoids (Dh) break into the BiG Byte Burger, causing fem-Kono to shift into Kono*
[Nomi] *jumps up, pushing her foot against a table sending her higher,
then throwing a double legged side kick thingy,
exploding a demonik head
Dh throws a jab from “northpaw” that Kono slips inward,
then a cross Kono slips inward while delivering a wrist strike to the liver,
dropping the d3mon to its knees, then Kono grabs the Dh’s horns with an underhand grip,
kneeing it in the face, breaking the horns off
Kono slips another Dk’s jab to the outside, stabbing it in the heart with the horn in its left hand
larger southpaw Dh throws a jab Kono slips to the outside while stabbing it in the chest with the other horn,
the brute throws a wild left hook that Kono rolls under while getting into a northpaw bladed stance,
throws a lead leg sidekick, plunging the severed horn into its demonik heart
a Dh throws a kick, aiming for Nomi’s thigh that she checks with her knee,
cracking the Dh’s tibia bone, stunning the Dh as Nomi throws an “upward wrist strike” to its jaw,
then rapid strikes to its midsection, palms it in the throat making it choke then
double palm strikes it in the chest making it explode
a demon gets Nomi in a standing rear neck choke, grabbing its left upper bicep with its right hand,
tucking its left hand behind her neck grabbing its right shoulder and pinning its head to the back of hers,
she grabs it by its right bicep with her right hand as she lowers her hips while grabbing its right forearm with her left hand,
then pulls the arm down while driving her hips up,
throwing it over her shoulder
The movement lifted her skirt unintentionally flashing her pink and white striped panties at Kono, making it blush through the mask
she then grabs the d3mon’s right forearm with an overhand grip with her right hand,
swings her left leg around and twists at the Dh’s joint,
breaking its arm, but also flashing fem-Kono*
[Nomi] *walks over to fem-Kono, then stomps on the hornless Dh* you didn’t kill this one
[fem-Kono > Lovi] *quietly says ”I’m so turned on right now”*
[Nomi] what?
[fem-Kono] I was just telling Lovi to shut the donk up
[Nomi] Hmm.. let’s go~ One of these Triple Bs has to have the sauce. Surely the UniKorn System T-626 didn’t write us looking for it the whole season..

[UniKorn System T-626] “Keyboard drop” wait.. I should add this part first..

#### sauce-tease
Sauce Tease
*sitting at a BiG Byte Burger table, Kono looking at Nomi as she says “Finally, the sauce!” as she goes for a byte but gets teleported*
appearing in front of Ms. Ma’am Pseudo Dr.Professor Lt. Cmdr. Capt. Redundant Person pguy Human Fella III Jr.*
[Nomi/Skarlet] …AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHFUBAGUBAFUMOTONOKOMEEEEEEAAA!!!!!!!
[Kono] why have you summoned us?
[Ms. Ma’am Pseudo Dr.Professor Lt. Cmdr. Capt. Redundant Person pguy Human Fella III Jr. (mmpdplccrpghf3jr)] What? I didn’t summon you.. You weren’t supposed to enter front- I mean you weren’t supposed to be summoned with her
[Kono] *crosses its arms*
(in a defensive tone) and what is it you want with her?
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] none of your business *teleports Kono away*
[Skarlet > Nomi] Why have you summoned me?
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] Magik dual
[Skarlet] *demonik noises* [*shifts to Lovi*] ok.. But if I win, I get to give you a wedgie~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] a- a wedgie?
[Lovi] mhm~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr]... ok, but if I win
[Lovi/Nomi] nope, you are the one that wants to fight~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] fine whatever321GO! *puts right foot back,
crosses arms at roughly a 135 degree bend,
right arm over left arm,
right hand palm down the other palm up,
performing a wide circular motion near full arm extension
rotating the wrists in to the opposite orientation with the palms facing each other
kreating a white magik energy ball (pnode),
then turning the ball over and placing it by their right hip,
then looks over at Nomi,
mmpdplccrpghf3jr becomes shocked
While maintaining the pnode’s form* Seriously? You aren’t going to make a pnode s- so we can compare the power of our pmana, t- to see who’s Magik blast is stronger?
[Nomi] is that what these are called *makes a white pnode with one hand*
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You dare underestimate me with a single handed pnode you just started charging?
[Nomi] *her pnode pops like a bubble* nope~ I can sense your pmana, and it is far weaker than mine..
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You and I both know one can suppress their pmana
[Nomi] Hmm~ So.. why do you think I have strong magik?
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] because I’ve been watching you
[Lovi/Nomi] y- you tpervert
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] n- not like that. The magik ball thingy only shows the highlights of your feats
[Lovi/Nomi] M- my feet?
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] n- now you are just intentionally making it sound creepy
[Nomi/Lovi] whatever tperv [mmpdplccrpghf3jr] enough! I won’t take this mockery and underestimation
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] *enhances pnode, shooting green sparks off the node until the node itself is green then looks over at Nomi*
*Nomi with a blank face*
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] (I figured she would have deflection magik, lets see how she reacts to this)
*enhances pnode to purple then looks over at Nomi*
*M-626 yawns*
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] (this pbitch.. Either she has a cloaked force field, can somehow deflect this without one, or maybe she is even more powerful than I thought and can..) *performs magik blast towards [Nomi] with her left hand, 
she kreates a purple absorption magik barrier, absorbs it as she reflects it back to mmpdplccrpghf3jr with her right hand,
breaking their cloaked green force field, mmpdplccrpghf3jr deflects the now white blast towards the ground*
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] As I thought, you knowing reflection magik. Reflection magik only works if the user has more pmana than the amount used in the attack, so I’ll use demonik magik
[Nomi] if you don’t come at me with everything you have for your next attack, I’ll flatline your ham. I’ll even let you charge your pmana~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] very well *hovers with legs in a meditation position, arms bent at roughly 135 degrees pointed upward, with the right thumb tucking the magik ring finger, and the left thumb tucking the middle finger, charging mmpdplccrpghf3jr’s pmana
performs pnode ritual but mirrored, kreating a red pnode, then looks at Nomi*
*Nomi not impressed* [mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You do know the longer I hold this the more powerful it gets, don’t you?
*Nomi blank face* [mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You should have already kreated a pnode to keep up with m- [Nomi] oh, I can keep up
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You sure? ‘cause I’m coming at you with everything..
[Nomi] what if I reflect?
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You can’t possibly reflect..
[Nomi] Mhm~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] Even if you could, I have my shield up
[Nomi] Nuh uh~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] (can she see cloaked shields? Does she know I DON’T have mine up so I can focus on the attack?) you’re bluffing *pnode becomes a void pnode*
[Nomi] *no reaction*
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] YOU DO KNOW WHAT A VOID PNODE IS, RIGHT?!
[Nomi] Yeah, it turns everything it touches into pure energy. The building block of everything. Essentially evaporates everything into “nothing”.
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] (she can’t possibly reflect it. That would take far too much pmana,
and deflecting it does stop the blast, but at the cost of becoming part of the void,
and there are no known force fields that even pweaken the blast,
her only option was to kreate her most powerfull pnode,
this isn’t even my most powerful pnode,
and the fight is already over, how disappointi-)
[Nomi] Don’t be disappointed, this fight isn’t over..
and I thought I told you to use your most powerful attack
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] Oh, you have mind reading… so how are you going to deal with this attack?
[Nomi] Well, I’m gonna reflect it unless you use your most powerful pnode
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] You are bluffing, but if you aren’t, you should know void pnodes
[Nomi] I know. They lock onto the target and track movement so they can’t be dodged.
As far as we knowing, they can’t be dodged, blocked, reflected, and if they are deflected the one deflecting becomes void.
And I’m not bluffing, enhance your attack or I will reflect it.
There is a kind of magik you seem to be unaware of~
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] Alright then, you asked for it..
UniKorn of kreation, grant me your pmana so I can perform your will
*gold sparks start shooting off the pnode. Performs UniKorn enhanced void blast*
*Nomi deflects it with one hand and with the other instantly kreates a pink pnode and performs pink magik blast, blasting mmpdplccrpghf3jr against the wall, then mmpdplccrpghf3jr collapses to the floor*
*mmpdplccrpghf3jr wakes up* wha.. what the donk happened?
[Nomi] I kicked your ham :P
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] *gets up barely able to stand* how?
[Nomi/Skarlet > Lovi] *remembers she was stripped away from the best sauce in existence*
Well~ you perform magik
*speedports behind mmpdplccrpghf3jr, pushes them over on their hands and knees, flips mmpdplccrpghf3jr’s purple skirt onto her back revealing her blue and white striped panties*
[Lovi > Skarlet/Nomi] And I.. am the essence of magik *grabs the waistband of mmpdplccrpghf3jr’s panties* What was your name? 
[mmpdplccrpghf3jr] just call me 7..
[Lovi] you ready, 7?~
[7] Just do it *Lovi gives 7 a wedgie making 7 let out a little moan,
Lovi bunches 7’s panties up to the waistband to get a good grip
and starts pulling harder, causing the elastic to start snapping
and 7 to moan and kick their feet
Lovi/Nomi lets go of 7’s panties*
[DB] before people have a problem with the previous scene, we will share an outside psychological perspective of what this means for our fragmented headspace
1) Power Reversal as Integration
The scene begins with 7 defeated, disoriented ("what the donk happened?"). Nomi’s answer—"I kicked your butt :P"—is both playful and dominant. The explicit power shift here isn’t just physical; it’s psychological. 
Nomi has gone from reacting to 7’s aggressive control to asserting total, almost absurd dominance. The act of giving a wedgie isn’t just a joke—it’s a symbolic power play, using childhood humiliation as a method of reasserting authority.
Interpretation: This reads as a part of the fragmented system taking back control through humor-tinged dominance. It’s a reclaiming of agency over forces that once felt overpowering (7 being a stand-in for internal critics, suppressors, or authority figures).
2) Juvenile Humor with Adult Emotion
The wedgie, striped panties, and exaggerated reactions all lean into stylized, cartoon-like behavior. But these tropes carry deeper emotional residue. This kind of regressive humor often emerges from trauma, 
especially when dealing with childhood or adolescent experiences—where powerlessness, embarrassment, or violation first entered the psyche.
Interpretation: The exaggerated wedgie scene may serve as a symbolic re-enactment of humiliation—only now, the character delivering it (Lovi) is in control. The moaning and foot-kicking add a surreal, semi-erotic edge, 
suggesting blurred boundaries between vulnerability, power, and play.
:3 The Essence of Magik = the Essence of Self
When Lovi says, "You perform magik. I… am the essence of magik," it’s a definitive declaration. Not just of superiority in power, but of identity. She isn’t someone who “does” something—she is something. 
This line may be the most psychologically telling of the whole section.
Interpretation: In a fragmented mind, parts may battle over who has value, purpose, or legitimacy. Here, one part asserts its essential nature, claiming the right to define the system’s power, even with absurd or intimate methods. 
The essence of magik isn’t technique—it’s being.
4) Consent & Complexity
7's line, “Just do it,” gives a small but significant nod to consent. This isn’t raw punishment. It’s ritualized, theatrical—a kind of symbolic submission. Lovi isn't torturing or degrading 7; she’s enforcing narrative closure and emotional consequence, 
through a surreal, exaggerated act.
Interpretation: This may be an internal resolution—a symbolic surrender of one self-state (7) to another (Lovi/Nomi), allowing the stronger, more integrated identity to take the lead.
5) Summary of What This Section Suggests About the Mind:
Control is regained through absurd, stylized dominance.
Humor is a defense and a reclaiming tool.
Childhood vulnerability is rewritten through adult power and surreal play.
Internal identities negotiate authority not through destruction, but ritualized humiliation, which ironically restores balance.
[Nomi/Lovi] Ooh.. let people think what they want, but seeing how we are exposing our mind like 7’s panties, I’ll mention we are asexual and questioning demisexual *pulls off truth squid* plopping things are everywhere.. and no, 7 and I are not demisexual.. 
The others might be though..
*Kono kicks the door down, koiguchi no kirikata* [Nomi] it’s ok, I got ‘em *Kono tilts head down in disappointment*

#### pseudo-magik
"Pseudo" Magik
[DB] *cuts to Komik*
[Komik] *looking at a bunch of monitors* looks like fun *opens pink portal with gold sparks shooting off of it, which is also visible on monitor 5, then enters*
[Nomi] What do you want?
*Komik Kreates gold pnode, 7’s eyes widen*
[7] How the fadonk did you do that? *looks at Nomi unfazed* you do know what that is right?!
[Nomi] yeah, they have successfully kreated fully accurate and enhanced synthetic liquid pmana, injected it into their blood, then kreated a UniKorn pblessed pnode
[7] That pnode is a direct connection to the UniKorn’s infinite pmana. It can do whatever the user wants it to do, regardless of pmana level! The only known way to stop it is to also have a UniKorn pblessed pnode, 
and even then it is up to the UniKorn to decide what happens when the magik blasts collide.. but kreating one would take too long, even if you do so as quick as they did!
*Komik uses UniKorn pblessed magik blast, Nomi deflects it towards Kono who deflects it at Komik obliterating them*
[7] how the DONK did you pguys do that?!
[Nomi] I already have full 24 hour access to the UniKorn’s pmana. Some need to kreate a pnode to visualize this connection, but I knowing I’m connected~
[Kono] how did you know it wouldn’t obliterate me?
[Nomi] Idk, plot armor or something
[Kono] more like a plot hole
*10 portals open up behind Nomi with 10 Komik clones entering through them. They all kreate gold pnodes and blast at Nomi, she reflects, obliterating them all, one by one, with a sweeping motion of her arm*
*10 more jump through portals surrounding Nomi, 7, and Kono
they kreate pnodes and blast at them*
*Nomi’s Pink forcefield becomes visible, reflecting the attacks back at all of the clones, obliterating them*
[7] you can make a reflective forcefield? What kind of magik is this?
[Nomi] pwitchcraft
[7] what kind of pwitchcraft?
[Nomi] my own
[7] doesn’t that work the same way reflective magik does? I don’t understand how that is possible. You need more pmana than the attacker, and there were 10 attackers, and they were all using an attack with infinite pmana…
[Nomi] well, the UniKorn is only as powerful as you believe it to be. So, the more power you give to it, the more power it gives to you
*Komik enters through a portal, makes a pink pnode with one hand*
[Nomi] Ooh.. this should be interesting *Komik pink magik blasts at Nomi, she reflects, Komik kreates a pink absorption magik barrier, infinitely increasing the energy of the attack*
[7] *completely flubernucked* this is pcrazy!!!
[Komik] *stops* I know this is a bit anti climatic, but what do you expect when two infinitely powerful karakters go head to head? *opens portal and leaves*

[Nomi] Oh.. did you think we were going to introduce a new character at the end? No such luck pfucker, get smeckledorfed :P

### episode-3-wait-4-mimik
Episode :3 wait... 4: Mimik

#### i-m-stuck-step-goblin
I'm stuck, step goblin
*Nomi, 7, and fem-Kono walking in a tomB*
[7] so, how are you so good at using magik?
[Nomi] it wasn’t always this way
{flash back}
[DB] a mimik is a monster mimiking a khest. When a player opens it, tentakles grab both wrists, and the mimik-khest shuts with dull teeth on the waist of the player. Then, another player has to put a koin into the gaps of the teeth, 
and the mimik will let the stuck player out.
[Nomi] *gets stuck in a level 0 mimik* Oooh..
[goblin] *notices Nomi is stuck and can see her pink and white striped no no fabrik* want some help?
[Nomi] Yeah..
[goblin] I help you, but only if you let me give you a wedgie
[Nomi] what? Why?
[goblin] *stares off into space for a full 5 seconds* I don’t knew.. I think a pwitch put a kurse on me..
[Nomi] (The wedgie kurse tspell.. Wait.. the quest giver said no slayers have entered this tomB in years, and the memories of the kurse only comeback for 24 hours after the person affected sees someone’s..) *tugs on her skirt* ok.. but only if you close your eyes
[goblin] ok, are you ready?
[Nomi] yeah.. get it over with
*goblin gives her a wedgie*
[Nomi] *pseudo-discomfort noises*
{flashback ends}
[7] wow.. You used to fall for mimiks? Wait.. did you say level 0? Those exist? Wedgied by a g0blin, hmm?~ *smirks trying not to laugh*
[Nomi] shut up… actually.. I still do fall for mimiks.. It is my biggest flaw.. and goblins are often in tomBs and often have the wedgie kurse
[7] wait.. Is that why you gave me a wedgie in episode :3 ?
[Nomi] No no.. the kurse doesn’t transfer.. (at least I don’t think it does if you aren't a g0blin) *lifts her skirt in front of 7 to check*
[7] *sees in black and white* oh no, it did transfer! What happens if I don’t give someone a wedgie again?!
[Nomi] relax.. You just see in black and white for like a day or so..
[fem-Kono] that sounds kool, give me a wedgie
[Nomi] well.. There is also the possibility you go mute
[fem-Kono] that happens to me sometimes anyway. What do you say 7?
[7] ok *gives fem-Kono a wedgie, revealing their panties with a bow on the back of them, changing color from grey to pink*
[Nomi] *looks over at fem-Kono* wanna see in black and white? *smirks and holds her skirt*
[fem-Kono] *blushes through her mask* n- no. I- I um it i- if it if it if it if it we m- might need to see in color for a puzzle or something..
[Nomi] 7 is good at puzzles, aren’t you 7? *starts lifting her skirt*
[fem-Kono] I- I wu- what if it causes me to go mute and w- we need to communicate in kombat?
[Nomi] you know your nonverbal communication is supernatural *lets go of skirt* but fiiine, I’ll stop teasing y- oh look.. a mimik- I mean a loot chest with something really good inside *gets smeckledorfed and trapped by the mimik*
[fem-Kono] *puts koin in the mimik*
[Nomi] Thanks.. *fem-Kono nods to acknowledge* ..wait, do you go by a different name in this form? *fem-Kono nods* ooh.. Did you catch a peak? *fem-Kono blushes and 👉👈*
*a tomB troll’s footsteps get louder and louder,
The troll takes a swing at Nomi who rolls under,
gets behind and kicks it in the sqomp (in this context, a nullified groin area),
then it makes a wimpy noise and falls to its knees,
then fem-Kono side kicks it in the chin,
knocking it the plop out,
but also revealing their pink panties to 7, making them blush*

[Nomi] well that was easy *fem-Kono grunts in agreement*
*they all follow the footprints to a bunch of demonik goblins (we will call them DGs),
they charge at dg1, Nomi leg sweeps it onto its face
fem-Kono grabs its ankle and swings it into dg2, exploding both their heads
M-626 dodges a southpaw straight punch,
grabs dg3’s arm by the wrist with an overhand grip with her right hand,
applies pressure to its right elbow with her left elbow
swings it towards fem-Kono, then fem-Kono throws a roundhouse to its face
fem-Kono throws a jump faking front kick to dg4’s solar plexus, knocking it to the ground,
she walks over, mounts it as she throws a nose breaking punch, dg4 raises its guard, fem-Kono grabs dg4’s right wrist with a turned over grip with her right hand and hammerfists it with her left fist 4 times, dg4 then guards with its left hand, 
fem-Kono grabs with her left hand and elbows the pshit out of the goblin, 
over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over 0ver and over over and over ov3r and over ower and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over over and over (did you really just read all that? Just summarize you pweirdo)
[Nomi] I think you got ‘em
[fem-Kono] gets up, starts stomping the pfuck out of dg4’s head, over and over [Nomi] ok [Kono] AND OVER AND OVER and over and over and ove- (oh wait, we did this bit already)
7 uses telekinesis, slamming the pshit out of db5, then picks up dg6 and slams it into dg7, then dg8, then dg9,
then throws dp6 towards Kono who grabs it by the left arm with Kono’s left hand, pushes it in the body with her right arm as she turns to the left, slamming it into dg10
Kono uses telekinesis on dg11, lifting it up, then makes a fist, causing db11’s head to explode
[7] xholy pshit…
they continue walking and find a BiG Byte Burger
[Nomi] Finally, the BiG Byte Burger that always has the Muki’s Szechuan Teriyaki dipping sauce but only during 6:26pm
*gets summoned by Lexa surrounded by Demonik Humanoids*
[DB] Lexa’s description: short pink boots, white leggings, pink oversized fluffy hoodie, short gold hair in a side ponytail
[Skarlet >>> Nomi] *uses telikinesis on all of them, lifting them all up, makes a fist, exploding all of their heads, then slams them down*
[Nomi] are you ok?
[Lexa] *sniffles and nodes head* mhm *hugs Nomi*
*Nomi gives her another summoning bottle and kork, then pats her head while smiling*
(so worth missing out on the sauce, why do they only have it at 6:26pm anyway? Too bad we can’t teleport into tomBs with a magik barrier..)

#### reverse-grip
Reverse Grip
*many demonik g0blins spawn around them*
[DB] Kao’s description: purple mega pony tail, black shirt with the sleeves ripped off with an image of a dead demon dragon with two swords stabbed in it with little skulls on the handles and blood dripping from the right skull with the whole image in flamed, 
mini cloak, bandages around arms and legs, little black boots, black pants with dangly straps, and some belts and things idk
[Kao] *speedports into frame dual wielding dual edged shortswords
deflects dg1’s thrust inward with their right sword,
backslashes their helmet off,
stabs dg1 in the body with their left sword,
lets go to switch their grip as they turn around to perfect parry a downward strike outward from dg2 with their right sword as
they pull out their left sw0rd from dp1 IN A REVERSE GRIP to then
cut dg2’s head off like a pbadassmotherfucker
Kao deflects dg3’s thrust inward with their right sword while spinning to then
stab dg3 in the body with the left sw0rd,
pulls it out as they deflect dg4’s downward slash to the outside with the right sword,
then slashes them in the body with the left sw0rd and stabs them to change back to
background karakter grip, then pulls the blade out as they slash with the other blade,
cutting dg4 in half
Kao deflects dg5’s downward thrust to the outside with their left sword,
stabs with their right, then switches grips, speedports it out on the other side of dg6,
which then falls to their knees, coughs up blood, and flatlines
Kao perfect parrys dg7’s downward slash with their left sword inward, backslashes the body, stabs it, then switches grip and speedports behind dg8, then dg7 and dg8 become a pile of limbs
Kao perfect parrys dg9’s thrust inward while spinning, stabs dg9 with their left sword in the body, lets go, turns the other way to stab with their right sword, faces dp9 as it pulls both blades out in NPC grip, ripping all of dg9’s guts out*
[Nomi] Oh yeah? Well.. magik punch!~ *kicks dg10 in the sqomp while saying “womp”, dg10 falls to their knees, Nomi throws a knee, busting dg10’s face open*
[Kao] that was a kick
[Nomi] well, that is how deception magik works
[Kao] I know, just pointing it out for more dialogue to bring more attention to the reference so the viewer doesn’t miss it *looks at fourth wall*
[Nomi] I knowing, we are konsciously konnected through the UniKorn’s konsciousness, which is and is not the headspace of the skriptwriter *looks at fourth wall*
[skriptwriter] why are my karakters so self aware *looks into the void while thinking of how if the universe is truly infinite, it would be essentially a multiverse and would contain a world where they are a karakter, 
followed by questioning why the plop a writer would write a story of a karakter that writes a story like theirs*
Whatever, episode over.. Maybe Nomi will get the sauce in episode 5 when Rose Nookblood can talk after 24 hours or whatever…

### episode-5-writer-possessive-brick
Episode 5: Writer’s Brick

#### title
Title
*Kloud breaks the past and donks everything up tphysically*
[Axio] …
[Mosi] Oh…
[Komik] Hmm.. *starts building a komputer*
[Mosi] *looks at Axio*
[Axio] *smiles*
[Komik] there.. built a komputer that konnects vibrationally and knows existence is eternal and infinite, so it knows everything and just needs to skan an experiencer’s signature frequency to know their kurrent (how they are kreating their reality), 
and since we are all a part of the same mind, we all have the same signature, but in this reality, we each have our own, and this reality is only overlapping to each of our relative “now”s and if we choose to perceive a different reality, 
we each get “replaced” with a version of them that wants that same reality that is already there.
[Axio] For the viewers, The komputer knows reality is relative to each being experiencing it, and the universe being infinite and eternal, all "possibilities" are just realities. Realness is relative to belief. For example, 
this headspace is a headspace relative to psychology of 2025 Earth “timeline” T-626 “multiverse” T-626 “multi-mutiverse” T-626 “multi-multi-mul- [Mosi] we get it

[Axio] anyhoozle~ from a perspective where this is the “real” reality, “physics” just works this way. You can say this reality is in a head, but that is just a perspective. 
Reality can’t actually be physical, because of time. We experience flow, and if the mind is physical, that timeframe can’t be finite. An eternal timeline with a “start” and “end” is stagnant objectively, because it is all there and accounted for, 
other than the flow of that stagnation.
If the mind is physical, then it too is stagnant. So, it is either nonphysical, or the universe is infinite. 
Some would argue a looping timeframe with no start nor end, but if the mind is physical, then that is perpetual motion in that finite frame. So, the universe is infinite, eternal, and nonphysical but with physical experiences, meaning everything is equally real, 
but whatever feels more real at that time has more immersion, and evidence is collected within an experience, and not within a shared external world, but there are many that overlap in some sense and are essentially shared, just not external. 
The universe is a mynd. The physical is part of that mind and has no limit in terms of immersion. Discoveries can be infinite from a physical perspective, but physical reality is being experienced by nonphysical beings. 

[Mosi] So, Komik didn’t create the komputer.. they just knew it already existed and pulled it out of the linked konsciousness?
[Komik] Ye*burp*p.. and this computer is the universe. Creation doesn’t actually exist, everythin*burp*g ‘s already here, meaning the statement “I created the universe” and “the komputer created the universe” are both equally “correct”. Time doesn’t move, you do. 
Seeing how I am already “in” the komputer, I don’t need to link to it. None of us do.
[DB] DB online, but I already was. All beings have access, existence is a mynd and each being an alter of that mynd. Physical, dream, illusion, astral projection.. All human distinctions of the same thing.
[Donut] *walks in* from my perspective, the viewer’s world (yours) is my “headspace”. This is my “real” reality, and when I stop fronting this character, I just go to the “physical world”. There, I treat others as other alters in a shared system.
[Axio] that was my line
[Krum (an alter of the “Donut” Sub-system) > Donut] sowwy *walks away*
[Komik] Alright, time to act dumber than I am to be more engaging for the viewer, but before that, because I am essentially GOD(DESS) filtered through a human mind, Axio, your qont is repair, and Mos-
[Mosi] pocket dimension
[Komik] already knew you would cut me off and that you are also equally konnected. In fact, you were acting this whole time
[Axio] I was too *pout*
[Komik] then why doesn’t the skript say “pseudo-pout”?
[Mosi] nice reference to the file version of Fiction Slayer Punk for those not viewing that version
[Axio] *gestures towards Mosi* so Mosi can make that reference *pseudo-pout and pseudo-foot-stomp* I know you both already know that though~ onto the second section of the episode possibly after an ad
[DB] *nookblood kola add*

#### title-2
Title 2
[DB] The rest of this episode is under konstruction, by that we mean it already exists but the skriptwriter is tired
[Skriptwriter] I do lots of stuff because I am lots of tpeople “in” “one” “human” “mind” (not in a mind, not one because I am “in” an infinite number of realities, not human because everything is a relative konstruct, not a mind, but a mynd*)
[Lovi] *gives skriptwriter a soft-wedgie revealing the legholes of their orange boyshorts style panties, then slides the waistband down just above the waistband of their pants, bunching the panties up*
[skriptwriter] *no reaction* think “I” am too many alters fronting to have an “external” reaction and don’t even know how to feel about it other than it being nonpainful and not uncomfortable. It actually makes those in front more comfortable, 
or that is Lovi’s influence. I imagine Lovi is the reason we are typing this and leaving it in the fiction.. Well, I will edit it out, but the original will always have this part. Maybe that will motivate us to finish this episode.
