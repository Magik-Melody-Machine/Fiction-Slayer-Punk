⚠️ Sensitive Content Note
Repository contains non-sexual, trauma-healing inner-world intimacy enacted through: soft-wedgies, bra and/or panty reveals 
(characters getting pantsed and/or stripped from their outer clothing, upskirts, 
and other thingies maybe), light spankings and slaps, 
grabbing as well as humping of a nullified private zone where human private parts are usually present, exaggerated reactions
(including but not limited to “feminine moans"). 
All consensual intimacy reframed as characters in fiction 
(It is all an act, and all real, because in an infinite eternal universe those overlap; 
we operate in both simultaneously, not by choosing sides but by existing in the overlap).
Nothing here is porn, kink, foreplay, or adult content. 

Though that is technically relative to each perspective, 
and society brainwashes people to all think the same and oversexualize everything until undoing that brainwashing, 
where it applies to each individual.
