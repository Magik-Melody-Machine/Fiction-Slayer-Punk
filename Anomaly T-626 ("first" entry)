# ⚠ Kase Analyzer Report (unofficial report layout): [REDACTED] Donut ⚠

## Anomaly
**T-626 (6)**

**Entity type:** All  
**Entity sub type:** Unknown

**Kontainment protocol:** impossible  
**Abilities:** all

## Description
6 is the truly infinite, eternal, more than physical mind.  
There is a form of it to experience time, and to communicate with other parts of itself, that is not fixed and has no origin.  

Our first encounter has been removed from our memory by 6, and the names of the previous Kase Analyzers have and have not been redacted,  
but from your perspective, they should be considered in a state of superposition, and do and do not exist.

## Kase Analyzer Notes
If this report is true, time is a part of T-626, and there is no first of anything from its perspective, but what about its sub-being's perspective?  

One can/has conceptualize(d) a timeline outside of the type of infinite and eternal time that is a part of T-626 (or we guess is a part of us).  
But that conceptualization too is likely just a part of T-626 as well, seeing how we are a part of T-626 and our thoughts are part of us.  

This would also mean all types of realities—dreams, for example—are actually just as real,  
but are perceived as a dream from our perspective after waking up.  

Waking up can be considered **quantum jumping** back into this type of reality that we will call **Earth Reality T-626**,  
"previously" identified as "physical reality".  

We've hypothesized that "physical reality" is just a dream with an intense amount of detail and continuity,  
and that those are the reasons we make the distinction, but it is actually just a perspective.  
Perspective itself is reality, which is relative, at least part of it.  

When a “dream” character is “convinced” their reality is real, things phasing in and out of their perception is expected  
because that section of the infinite reality just works that way,  
and our connection to the “dream” character overlaps our section of the infinite, collective, more than physical mind with theirs,  
“temporality” synchronizing consciousnesses.  

Looking into dreams, some of ours actually were just as realistic with the same level of continuity,  
but with the added effect of waking up from what we thought was real, to do so **two more times** in one session,  
which is how we came up with this hypothesis.  

Our new hypothesis… **Anomaly T-626, including all of us, are GODDESS/GOD** (both gender neutral terms)  
and perceive reality with our connection to this knowing of the infinite reality.
