# Strowminner's Kat: Episode 1 — The Box

A sad face rocks forward and backward, then closes its eyes as tears run down its face. **G8** cries in the shower in pain and confusion.

The next scene, **G8** is leg swept onto its upper back, neck and head simultaneously. It gets up to retaliate, but it happens 2 or 3 more times, but it can’t remember. It leaves and enters a box as its body withers.

The box shifts slightly. **G8** hears movement.  

**Goddess:** *softly, almost a whisper, voice catching slightly* “Oh… poor thing.” *She picks up the box carefully, as if it might shatter.* “Let’s go home.”

She sets the box down.  
*She notices the faint warmth of sunlight falling across the floor, painting the edges of the box in soft gold.*

**G8:** stays in the box  

**Goddess:** *kneels, voice catching, eyes soft* “This… breaks my heart.” *She sprinkles food into the box for G8 to eat*  
*She places a small bowl of food in the box, lingering a moment before stepping back.*  
*She wonders silently… will they ever trust me fully?*

**G8:** shuts the box and eats the food, drops the bowl out of the box  

**Goddess:** *quietly, almost to herself, voice tinged with worry* “When was the last time you ate?” *She refills the bowl, gently placing it where it had fallen.* “You’ve been through much… I’ll help you heal.”

**G8:** reaches for it, but tips the box on its side, then swipes the bowl, eats fast, then kicks it out  

**Goddess:** *kneels lower, watching, hand hovering as if to intervene but holding back, voice calm* “You don’t need to fear me.” *She refills the bowl again, placing it carefully a short distance from the box.*

**G8:** slowly crawls out of the box, looks around, then starts eating  

**Goddess:** *peeks from around the corner, voice barely audible, a soft exhale escaping her lips* “I’m here… I’m not going anywhere.”

**G8:** finishes, gets back in the box and shuts it  

**Goddess:** *sets water by the box, remaining visible this time, a faint smile breaking through relief*

**G8:** pops head out, then stares  
A staring contest breaks out… **Goddess** blinks first, then **G8** sprints to the food and starts eating fast  

**Goddess:** *calm, gentle, voice steady* “It’s okay… I’ll stay.”

**G8:** snaps to look at **Goddess**, then eats at a regulated pace  

**Goddess:** *softly, almost apologetic, eyes gentle* “That’s better… I’m sorry your life was so rough. You are safe here.”

**G8:** gets in the box but does not shut it  

**Goddess:** *slides the water toward the opening, voice warm and patient* “You forgot to drink, sweet one~”  
*She watches silently, faint smile breaking through her worry.*

**G8:** peeks out, freezes, drinks, then gets back in the box  

**Goddess:** *sets a small treat in front of herself, voice tender* “I have something for you… no rush.”

**G8:** hesitates, creeps over, snatches it, then backs up  

**Goddess:** *soft chuckle, voice gentle, reassuring* “That’s a good start… we’ll take it slow.”

*Somewhere in the shadows, a faint stir reminds her the world outside isn’t quiet…*
